----------
LinkedList:
1. **Add and Access Elements**:
   Write a Java program that creates a `LinkedList` of integers. Add the numbers 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 to the list. 
   Retrieve and print the first and last elements in the list.
2. **Iterate and Modify Elements**:
   Create a Java program that initializes a `LinkedList` of strings with the values {"one", "two", "three", "four","five"}.
   Use a `ListIterator` to iterate through the list and replace every occurrence of the word "three" with "THREE". Print the 
   modified list.
3. **LinkedList Operations**:
   Write a Java program that creates a `LinkedList` of integers. Add the numbers 1 to 10 to the list. Then, remove the 
   third element (index 2) and the last element from the list. Print the resulting list.
4. **Queue Behavior with LinkedList**:
   Create a Java program that uses a `LinkedList` to simulate a queue. Add the names {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana"} 
   to the queue. Remove two names from the front of the queue, then print the names that remain in the queue.
5. **Reverse LinkedList**:
   Write a Java program that creates a `LinkedList` of characters with the values {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'}. Write a method to
   reverse the linked list and print the reversed list.
