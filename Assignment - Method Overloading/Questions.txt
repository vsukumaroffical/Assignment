1. Create a Java class MathOperations with methods for basic mathematical operations such as add() , subtract() , multiply() , and divide() . Implement method overloading to allow these operations for integers, doubles, and optionally, other types.
2. Create a class named Person. Overload the constructors such that first constructor takes a single String argument for the name, second takes a String argument for the name and an int argument for the age and third constructor takes a String argument for the name, an int argument for the age, and a String argument for the address. Create a Main class with a main method to test the Person class by creating objects using each constructor and printing their details.
